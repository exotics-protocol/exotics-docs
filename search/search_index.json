Introduction We are releasing an early beta of our gaming protocol while iterating towards a general access release. We aim to offer fairer odds than any bookmaking available by using real protocol owned liquidity (POL) as counterparty to users bets. We will grow the POL organically by generating real revenue from genuine use cases. Using this POL will enable us to implement new game/event inputs and wagering engines. This initial release is an alpha release and our contracts aren't verified , we do plan to do this after a security audit by a reputable organisation. The only user funds at risk are non determined bets, however this risk is tempered by having maximum bet limits set quite low. There are workarounds of course but please use your own judgement when playing (funds may be with sifu). Protocol Overview The architecture of the system is quite simple. One central contract is the \"house\" (and holds the POL), games (contracts) can be enabled (with risk limits) to both contribute to and draw from the POL. Doing this helps both seperate our concerns with logic and enable us to introduce new gaming experiences while having the usage of the POL. The games contain the actual logic of the wagering engine and the interface for users to bet on. This decoupling could allow independently developed games make use of the POL in their own game with acceptance of the game being decided by governance vote. Our initial relase uses an parimutuel wagering engine system. Our current release target includes: * A single intentionally simple game contributing to POL * Using POL as a \"jackpot\" feature in game POL The POL allows games to be registered with it and to use its POL in their own engines. The POL contract is still being developed and eventually ownership of the contract will be fully controlled by token holders. Initially we do envision needing updates to the POL contract to develop a flexible interface that can provide support for a large variety of games. The POL contract also holds all the XTC tokens designated as rewards and can enable and disable them for individual games. POL contribution An adjustable fee (currently set to 0.5%) of each wager amount is contributed to building protocol owned liquidity. This is calculated by taking the fee amount of the total msg.value sent to the game while betting. This fee along with all others will eventually be delegated to gauges voted on by protocol token owners. Revenue Fee There is also a fee (currently set to 0.5%) that is charged for usage of the protocol. XTC token The XTC token is a fair launch token that is used during the bootstrap phase to incentivise users to place bets. This token will be used in the future to govern the protocol parameters and also enables users to take part in revenue sharing. The token distribution as part of games does not follow a pre-defined emission schedule. The protocol team reserves the right to use emissions as we deem the most effective way to grow the protocol. There are no token sale events planned and their are no third party investors in our project. Revenue distribution Holders of the XTC token who stake in the RevenueStaking contract earn a proportion (based on the weight of their XTC vs sum of all stakers) of all revenue fees. Fees accrue in real time and are always claimable. Initial game. The initial game we release is dog track simulator. It uses a parimutuel wagering system and a fixed probability random outcome. The odds from the wagering engine should track the fixed probability as if not arbitrage could exist between real vs virtual odds. The betting pools will ultimatly accomadate many advanced bet types (each way/exacta etc) but initially is released with a single choose winner bet.","title":"Exotic Gaming"},{"location":"about/#exotic-gaming","text":"The exotic protocol is a decentralised gaming application.","title":"Exotic Gaming"},{"location":"about/#introduction","text":"We are releasing an early beta of our gaming protocol while iterating towards a general access release.

It will include the launch of many small revenue generating games. These will gradually increase in complexity and make greater use of the protocols liquidity. Our initial game is a twist on the classic dice game but modified to enable growth from zero initial balance. Check back frequently as we have a number of games in the pipeline. Dice game Our first game we have kept incredibly simple (KISS) and is a game based on the outcome of a weighted dice. It uses the parimutuel betting system to calculate probabilities and payouts. This has the effect that the odds are not known until the pool of wagers is closed, to offset this we will reward early players of the game with XTC tokens. As this game uses a pooled payout it runs on a frequency and is not an instant win game (although our future games may be). A new role takes place every 10 minutes. XTC tokens are distributed as rewards to all players of the game, to further incentive early betting (which are at a disadvantage due to changing odds) the incentives will be greatest 10 minutes (are earlier) before the role starts, they drop by 10% each minute up until the game starts. As part of our Q4 roadmap we will be implementing a jackpot feature where rolls could be eligble for a bonus payout. To play the game visit our dapp and choose a roll to bet on. Fairness Roll results are provided by chainlink VRF providers. This ensures a fair and tamperproof way of deciding results. Calculations The following calculations and parameters are applied to the game. Protocol fee : An amount of the total wager added to the protocol owned liquidity Revenue fee : An amount of the total wager distributed to XTC stakers Odds : (wager - fees) * total selected outcome / sum all outcomes Roll ID : A timestamp of when the roll will take place","title":"Bootstrap"},{"location":"bootstrap/#bootstrapping","text":"Our bootstrap phase is our token distribution and protocol liquidity raise period.
